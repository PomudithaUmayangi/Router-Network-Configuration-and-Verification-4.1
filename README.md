🔍 Step 1: Checking Directly Connected Networks

Before we start configuring, let's check which networks are directly connected to each router. Here's what to do:

✔️ Access each router in privileged mode
✔️ Check the routing table to see directly connected networks
✔️ Take note of the connections for later use

Routers to check:

✅ Router A

✅ Router B

✅ Router C

🛠️ Steps to Configure

To set up the routers, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Enter privileged mode

2️⃣ Move to global configuration mode

3️⃣ Enable routing protocol (we're using RIP version 2!)

4️⃣ Disable automatic route summarization

5️⃣ Configure networks for proper communication


Routers to configure:

🖥️ Router A

🖥️ Router B

🖥️ Router C

🎨 Add a Banner

Make your router more welcoming by adding a custom banner! 🖼️ This banner will show up whenever someone logs into the router. Get creative! 🎉

🔗 Verifying Connectivity

Once the routers are set up, we need to check if they can talk to each other.

✅ Use the ping tool to test connections between routers
✅ If everything is working, you’ll see successful responses! 🎯
✅ If not, double-check your configurations 👀

🌍 Configuring Default Routing

Default routes help routers forward data to unknown destinations. If Router B isn't directly connected to an ISP, setting a default route will help it send traffic to the right place! 🚦

🎉 Congratulations! You've successfully configured and verified your routers. Keep exploring and tweaking your network setup for even better performance! 🚀💡
